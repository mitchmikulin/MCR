        <h1>About the Album</h1>
        <p>The Black Parade is a rock opera centering around the character of "The Patient". It is about his passage out of life and the memories he has of his life. "The Patient" dies and death comes for him in the form of a parade. This is based upon Gerard Way's notion of death appearing to a person in the form of their fondest memory, in this case seeing a parade as a child.</p>
        <p>The album also saw the creation of the alter-ego band, The Black Parade. My Chemical Romance would perform the album live in costume as the Black Parade up until October 7, 2007 Mexico City performance. On stage, the band would don black marching uniforms similar to those worn by The Beatles for the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). The live performance was theatrical, with Gerard Way assuming the character of a member of The Black Parade.
        <p>The album also has strong influences from 1970s classic rock, glam rock, pop music, punk rock and gothic rock. The Black Parade has been described as alternative rock, emo, pop punk, post-hardcore, and punk rock.</p>
        <p>"The intention was to make something that was classic, something timeless," explained guitarist Ray Toro. "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to when I was your age. Check it out, it’s still cool.'" We wanted to make a record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that."</p>

          <p>This song is on My Chemical Romance’s third studio album, entitled The Black Parade. The song, as well as the rest of the album, follows The Patient, a man who is dying. The idea is that Death comes for you in the form of your fondest memory; in the case of the Patient, it is a parade that his father took him to when he was young.</p>

          <p>The singer reminisces about his teenage years and attempts to convey the unfair prejudice against teenagers that he experienced.</p>
          <p>In this song, the singer (Gerard Way) talks about how adults are apprehensive of teenagers for no apparent reason. He remembers how when he was a teenager, “grown-ups” would be scared of him for no reason, and the idea for this song was born when he found that he himself was old enough to be nervous around teenagers.</p>
          <p>The song was written by Gerard when he was on a subway and had a panic attack because there were so many teenagers riding on it as well. When guitarist Frank Iero heard the song for the first time, he thought it was a joke.</p>

          <p>The final “proper” track on the album lets the listener decide whether or not The Patient does die. “Famous Last Words” is the ultimate power song from the famous concept album The Black Parade. It strengthens many fans, because of the determination and perseverance the band included in the lyrics.</p>
          <p>Frontman Gerard Way wrote this song for MCR bassist (and his brother) Mikey Way. Mikey temporarily left the band during the recording of the Black Parade album due to severe anxiety but agreed to resume working with them upon hearing this track.</p>
          <p>The music video for this song features a dishevelled My Chem playing their instruments while various props and pieces of Black Parade memorabilia burn all around them. It is a rather symbolic video, and considered by fans to be one of the heaviest, thematically – Gerard agrees, saying it was written at ‘the darkest period in this band’s career’.</p>
          <p>It’s also worth noting that almost every member of the band was injured in some way during the filming of the music video.</p>
