        <h1>About the Album</h1>
        <p>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is the second studio album from My Chemical Romance. The album was released in June 2004. Recording took place from October 2003 to January 2004 in Calabasas, California. This record is the last to feature Matt Pelissier on drums.</p>
        <p>Frontman Gerard Way has credited the album as a “pseudo-conceptual horror story.” The concept for this album is that a man, thought to be one of the Demolition Lovers from their first album, is gunned down in a fight, but makes a deal with the Devil that if he brings him the souls of a thousand evil men, his life will be restored and he’ll be reunited with his love – otherwise, he gets dragged to hell and will never see his lover again.</p>
        <p>The album boasted singles “I’m Not Okay (I Promise),” “Thank You For The Venom,” “Helena,” and “The Ghost of You.”</p>
        <p>The cover art was drawn by Gerard Way.</p>

        <p>“Helena” was written as a tribute to Gerard and Mikey Way’s late grandmother (who was called Helen by her friends). Her actual name was Elena.</p>
        <p>Gerard Way spoke about this song in an interview with Kerrang! magazine in February 2005:</p>
        <p>I have had a lot of self hate. The most recent example was the song ‘Helena’. It’s a really angry open letter to myself. It’s about why I wasn’t around for this woman who was so special to me, why I wasn’t there for the last year of her life. Self hate is always a big part of the lyrics. I’ve felt like that all my life. I don’t know why but I’ve always hated myself. Hopefully that self hate is growing into something else now, hopefully it’s grown into caring about myself and wanting to stay alive.</p>
        <p>He goes on to connect his problems with alcohol with the loss of his grandmother:</p>
        <p>“That was the worst moment of my life. I also think losing my grandmother and the drinking were probably connected. When I quit I could see myself clearly and I wasn’t sure how much I liked it. I wasn’t confident about anything, I was just depressed. Also, when you get sober, everyone is very honest about everything you’ve done. That can be hard.</p>

        <p>The story of this song goes that there is this girl with petty problems (such as her boyfriend sharing her naked photos) asking for help from her friend, the narrator. The narrator is suffering from very real problems but puts them aside to help the girl out, who doesn’t really listen to him.</p>
        <p>The running theme throughout the song is that she really does not understand the real problems of life. She loves all these songs with deep meanings, claims that they speak to her and that she can relate but really she doesn’t know what any of it means.</p>

        <p>Some things were even born out of [the comic]. On Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, the third single, “Ghost of You,” comes from the ad in Watchmen for Nostalgia [perfume] that says, “oh, how the ghost of you clings.”</p>

What is the music video about ?
Directed by Marc Webb, the music video echoes the Omaha beach invasion scene from the 1998 war film, Saving Private Ryan. The video alternates between shots of the band performing at a dance, and fighting as US soldiers during the D-Day Normandy landings. Bassist Mikey Way is later killed by German gunfire, despite guitarist Ray Toro’s attempts to save him..</p>
