        <h1>About the Album</h1>
        <p>Danger Days was the last studio album ever put out by American rock band My Chemical Romance. In true MCR spirit, the record is a concept album detailing the adventures of a group known as the Killjoys.
        </p>
        <p>The Killjoys are trying to overthrow an omnipotent company called Better Living Industries, which sells pills that claim to give people different emotions. The Killjoys are the only ones not brainwashed by their tyrannical ways, and vow to teach the public that emotions come from the heart.
        </p>
        <p>The album can also relate to the real world we live in with Better Living Industries being society, the drugged people being the world, the pills being the rules society has set for our lives, and the Killjoys being the people who are staying true to themselves and not letting society tell them how to live their lives.
        </p>
        <p>Danger Days is noticeably different from the band’s earlier albums. It has more of an upbeat, pop punk feel as opposed to their grungy songs of the past.
        </P>
        <p>Originally, Album 4 was comprised of the songs now part of the Conventional Weapons EPs, but the band decided to go in a different direction.

        <p>This is the second track on My Chemical Romance’s fourth album, Danger Days, which begins with a spoken introduction from Dr. Death Defying, continuing seamlessly from the previous track, “Look Alive, Sunshine.”</p>
        <p>This song was released as the album’s first single on September 28, 2010. It was one of their most successful singles, reaching #1 on the US Rock Chart; #9 on the Japan Hot 100; and #69 on the European Hot 100.</p>
        <p>It was released with a music video depicting the band as the Killjoys. In the video, the Killjoys fight against a corporation called Better Living Industries, and with video ends with a standoff in which all appear to die. However, the characters are very much alive, and the saga continues in the music video for “Sing.”</p>
        <p>MCR frontman Gerard Way told Billboard:</p>
        <p>“Na Na Na” is the song that changed everything – it’s the song that I wrote in the desert, and it came from a moment of extreme honesty, realizing that we hadn’t originally made the record we had hoped. It has probably the most direct lyrics I’ve ever written, and when we recorded it Rob [Cavallo, “Danger Days” producer] after meeting him, it was a very immediate thing. The momentum of “Na Na Na” carried us through day-to-day, propelled us, and we didn’t realize we were re-recording the album until we were four songs in.''</p>

        <p>The song is set in the world of the Fabulous Killjoys, a post-apocalyptic California. It talks about how the world is now run by a small group of people, and the rest of the world is silenced. The song calls for people to stand up and fight for what they believe in.</p>
        <p>Musically, this song speaks through silence. There is very little actual instrumentation behind a good deal of the song. This coveys the emptiness of the world that the song talks about.</p>
        <p>MCR frontman Gerard Way told Billboard:</p>
        <p>‘SING’ is the song I’m most proud of on the record. We had recorded ‘SING’ fourth and that’s when we realized we were re-tracking the album. What I love about it is that it’s the band finally writing music free of genre or anything else – writing music solely as fans of music and with a very broad, direct, world view. It started with a beat. The song just took this beat and that’s how we started writing it. We kind of mediated on that beat for days. The song ended up really important, really early for us so it was pretty great. That’s when we realized, ‘Alright, we’re doing something special here. We’re finally on to something. Let’s finish this album.’</p>

      <div>
        <p>In this song, Gerard is stressing how short life is. He doesn’t feel as if he can wait around for others without wasting his time, his life is moving so fast it’s just like a rush he couldn’t afford to miss out on without the least bit of regret.</p>
        <p>MCR frontman Gerard Way told Billboard:</p>
        <p>‘Planetary (GO!)’ is another beat-driven track, and my hope is that people will dance to it when we play it live.</p>
